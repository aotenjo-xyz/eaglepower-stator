## Eaglepower LA8308 BLDC Motor
This motor was originally designed for drones, so it’s built for **high speed and low torque**, which makes it **unsuitable for servo tasks or automation**. To change that, I’ll be rewinding it into a gimbal-style motor, optimized for **high torque at low speeds**—**perfect for robotics and precision**

## CNC Parts
Here are the CNC parts from [JLCCNC](https://jlccnc.com/?from=yuchi). All of these parts are made from aluminum 6061, and I’m seriously impressed by the quality—especially considering the price.

The part on the left features a brushed finish, while the others have a bead-blasted, anodized matte finish.

### Surface Finish
I tested two types of surface treatments: **brushing** and bead **blasting + anodizing**.

**Brushed finish** is more budget-friendly and still looks great.
**Bead blasting + anodizing** gives a sleek, professional appearance that really elevates the final build.

## Choosing Materials
I had the opportunity to experiment with several 3D-printed parts manufactured by JLC3DP, and in this section I’d like to share some practical guidance on material selection based on my experience.

### PA12-CF (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Nylon)
If you need high rigidity, your main options are CNC-machined parts or PA12-CF (FDM printing).

- For high-volume production, CNC machining is usually the better choice.
- For complex geometries or rapid iteration, PA12-CF is often more practical.

**PA12-CF** offers stiffness that is close to CNC-machined parts, making it suitable for structural components. However, as part size increases, the cost can rise quickly, so it’s best used for smaller or more intricate parts where machining would be inefficient.

### Resin Printing
If a **smooth surface finish** is critical, **resin printing** is an excellent option.

In my case, parts such as the wire guide and stator holder come into direct contact with enameled copper wire. To avoid damaging the insulation, these surfaces must be extremely smooth. Resin printing excels here, producing parts with minimal surface roughness straight out of the printer.

### SLS(Nylon) and MJF(Nylon)
For complex parts that would normally require support structures, **SLS** and **MJF nylon** are very good choices.

Because these processes **do not require supports**, you can design parts more freely without worrying about overhangs or post-processing. This is especially useful for enclosed geometries or mechanically complex designs.

As makers, we often do everything ourselves—soldering, machining, printing—to save costs. But when you consider your time and the quality [JLCCNC](https://jlccnc.com/?from=yuchi) delivers at competitive prices, it’s absolutely worth a look.

Huge thanks to the JLC team for sponsoring this project and providing such excellent support. And thank you for reading—I hope this post helps you in your own builds and explorations.
